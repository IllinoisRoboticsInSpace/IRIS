The IRIS Motor Driver handles the actuation of motors and linear actuators by various methods (Sabertooth, PWM, etc.) and handles any arduino based sensor inputs such as rotary encoders. This is all done to offload computation from the main robot computer and to simplify development. This motor driver is meant to enable a usb serial connected to the Arduino Due to command the devices on the robot. Therefore this driver includes a communication protocol and features for configuring the robot's sensors and motors.

# Features:
- Actuate Motors    (TODO)
- Read Encoders     (TODO)
- Configure Motors  (TODO)
- Debug Output      (TODO)
- PID Control       (TODO)
